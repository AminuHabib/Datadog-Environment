# Datadog-Environment
This exercise and solution is to demonstrate my hands-on experience learning the Datadog
platform, and implementing some of its capabilities.

## Part 1 - Creating my Datadog Environment
The first step is to **install the Datadog agent on a host**, such as on my
**Mac / Windows / Linux VM / Docker / Heroku**.

Then, **Monitor a Cloud based host** on **AWS** as a second step with the following
requirements:

1. Creating a cloud provider account (**AWS/GCP/Azure**)
2. Spinning up a server on the cloud provider (using free accounts)
3. installing the agent on the server (equivalent to the first step of
  installing the agent)
4. Setting up the cloud provider integration** (for example - **Amazon DynamoDB**,
  **Amazon ElastiCache, Amazon S3, Google BigQuery, Google Pub/Sub, Apache**).
5. Creating a **custom log file** for the *Agent* to tail and display the log
lines in the UI.
6. Creating a **monitor** to alert me on something that needs my attention.
